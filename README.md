This project classifies four four different types of recycables with a test accuracy of 97%.

## Specification
I ran this on anaconda virutal envorinoment in Windows 10 with:
- tensorflow-gpu 2.2.0
- Python 3.7.9
- cuDNN 7.6
- CUDA 10.1



Our dataset is comprised of images from four different classes: Glass bottles, Aluminum Cans, PET water bottles, and HDPE bottles. We combined two different datasets to create a large enough dataset to train the CNN. The first dataset is from Kaggle and the second is from Portland State University.
